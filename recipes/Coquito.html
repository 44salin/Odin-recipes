    <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. 
    It's made wih both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. 
    It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. 
    Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. 
    Feliz Navidad!</p>
